# SDS Course Knowledge Repository

## Welcome to the SDS Course Knowledge Repository!

This repository is dedicated to revising (and enhancing too!) my knowledge of the SDS (Stats for Data Science) course material. 
Here, you will find various resources, code snippets, and exercises that will help reinforce the concepts learned in the course. 
This repository is also aligned with my blog, **[Namita Learns](https://namitalearns.substack.com/)**, where I share insights, tutorials, and reflections on my learning journey.
